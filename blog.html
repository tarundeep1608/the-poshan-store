                    <hr>
                    Nutrition is known to be one of the key determinants of long term health outcomes. From early years right up to the twilight decade, what one eats directly impacts one's health today and tomorrow.

                    Protein is one of the most critical components in our daily diets. Why is it critical? Very simply the body can't really 'store' protein. Excess protein consumption gets converted to fat but there isn't any way excess fat can get converted to protein. So if your body does not get its fill of this critical building block, you can’t 'make it up' the next day or the day after. And this is what we call the protein gap.

                    Poshan - Good Made Easy!  At its core, Foodstrong is all about nutrition and good food. So we blended whey made from the antibiotic free, hormone free milk of grass-fed cows with natural curcumin-rich turmeric and pure antioxidant laden green tea. We are as obsessed with what we keep out of our food as we are with what we add into them. So, our blends contain no soy, no GMO, no antibiotics, no preservatives, no trans-fat, strictly no nasties!...

                    How much protein do you really need?

                    If 24 gm of protein, 30 grams of scoop size and 5.765 gm of BCAA mean nothing to you, then you are not alone. This is gibberish to most people. So we thought we should try and simplify (much to the dislike of the old school) the eternal question of “how much protein”?

Any Reward Point or Promo Code used for placing the 'Bulk Order' will not be refunded as per this cancellation policy. An order can be classified as 'Bulk Order' if it meets with the below mentioned criteria, which may not be exhaustive, viz:

                    <br>1. Products ordered are not for self-consumption but for commercial resale;

                    <br>2. Multiple orders placed for same product at the same address;

                    <br>3. Bulk quantity of the same product ordered;

                    <br>4. Invalid address given in order details;

                    <br>5. Any malpractice used to place the order.

                    <br>2. Shipping

                    <br>2.1 What locations do you deliver to?

                    <br>We primarily ship through our channel partner Delhivery. Our coverage areas are limited to the areas covered by our channel partner. In case, for whatever reason, your delivery address is not covered by our existing partners, on request, we will attempt to ship through alternate channel partners.

                    <br>2.2 How can I track the delivery of my order?

                    <br>We usually email you the tracking reference number of your shipment. You can request an update at talktous@foodstrong.co

                    <br>Please allow 5-7 days for your order to reach. If you are in Mumbai we’ll probably get your order to you sooner than that. Metro areas usually reach within 3-5 days.

                    <br> 2.5 Why is the CoD option not offered in my location?

                    <br> The availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier partner servicing your location to accept cash as payment at the time of delivery. Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on the destination and your order value might have exceeded this limit.

                    <br>2.6 Any disputes in relation to this policy will be settled by reference to the terms set in the General Terms and Conditions
